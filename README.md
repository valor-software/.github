In a nutshell, weâ€™re crazy about building software products utilizing edge technologies and weâ€™re huge open-source fans.


## :ukraine: How itâ€™s started
The whole story started back in 2013 when Dmitriy Shekhovtsov, the first Google developer expert in Angular in Ukraine, launched a technology startup. It quickly developed into one of the fastest-growing development companies in the Eastern region of Ukraine. 



## :earth_asia: How itâ€™s going
Now, Valor has gone global, with Valorians on 5 continents! We have an international team with over 130 professionals including folks from the US, Georgia, Brazil, Greece, Czech Republic, and many other countries!


## :heart_on_fire: Love to open source is the only way 
Love is all about giving and receiving, right? :) We believe it's important to not just take from OSS but give back with knowledge-sharing, tooling, and professional services. 

## Our product

You might have already heard of ngx-bootstrap â€“ the library of components for Angular, weâ€™ve created it. Start using or join the team to develop [**ngx-bootstrap!**](https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## NativeScript

As Principal NestJS Sponsors and evangelists, weâ€™ve been trusted with not just modernization using NestJS, but training for teams who have used Java and .NET for server-side before. 



## Module Federation

Module Federation has boldly entered the market and been adopted by the ecosystems of giants like SAP and Google. Weâ€™re proud to have Valorâ€™s CEO among the leading practitioners and advocates for the technology. It goes to the extent that [**Manfred Steyer**](https://twitter.com/ManfredSteyer), Angular consultant, GDE, and Microsoft MVP, mentioned Dimaâ€™s contribution in his book about Module Federation.
